https://argoproj.github.io/rollouts/[Argo Rollouts,window='_blank'] provides a
drop-in replacement for Kubernetes deployments with support for advanced deployment
strategies. Whereas Kubernetes deployments support simple rollout and recreate strategies, Argo Rollouts supports
Blue-Green and Canary strategies.

To support these advanced deployment strategies, Argo Rollouts provides additional features.
Rollouts allows users to provide analysis to drive the progressive delivery. These analysises,
specified in an AnalysisRun, enables the testing of the Rollout by defining the nature of the
testing, the frequency and occurence and what constitutes a pass/fail.

Support for Argo Rollouts is provided by the OpenShift GitOps operator as a Tech
Preview feature as of OpenShift GitOps 1.10.
