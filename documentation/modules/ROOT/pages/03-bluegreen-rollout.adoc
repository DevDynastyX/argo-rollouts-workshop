== Blue-Green Overview

In a blue-green deployment we deploy a new version of the application in a separate stack from the current version with
the two versions running in parallel for a period of time. This enables testing on the new version while users continue
to access the current version of the application until a cut-over of traffic happens.

The diagram below shows this process over time.

In traditional infrastructure this approach can very challenging and while Kubernetes is simpler due to it's declarative nature the process still tends to be cumbersome to manage since bespoke automation needs to be created to manage the separate stacks,
testing and traffic management between versions.

This is where Argo Rollouts comes in, it greatly reduces the complexity by providing these capabilities with a simple, declarative approach. In this module
we will deploy a simple blue-green Rollout and explore it's basic capabilities.

[#deploy-blue-green-rollout]
== Deploy Blue-Green Rollout

Here we will deploy the blue-green rollout in the `user%USERNUM%-prod` namespace following the same process that we did for the Deployment in the previous module. Prior to starting,
confirm you are still at the correct path.

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
cd ~/argo-rollouts-workshop/documentation/modules/ROOT/examples/
----

Next, let's explore the manifests that we will be deploying in the `./bluegreen/base` folder:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
ls ./bluegreen/base
----

Notice that this time we have files for `rollout.yaml`, `services.yaml` and `routes.yaml` which represent our Rollout, Services and Routes. We also have
`kustomization.yaml` as per the last module.

.link:https://github.com/OpenShiftDemos/argo-rollouts-workshop/blob/main/documentation/modules/ROOT/examples/bluegreen/base/rollout.yaml[./bluegreen/base/rollout.yaml,window='_blank']
[source,yaml,subs="+macros,attributes+"]
----
include::ROOT:example$bluegreen/base/rollout.yaml[]
----

Notice that the structure of the Rollout is quite similar to the Deployment, it still uses the standard
Kubernetes link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/#pod-templates[PodTemplate,window='_blank'] but note that
under `.spec.strategy` we have specified the `blueGreen` strategy. The Kubernetes Deployment object supports `rollout`
and `replace` strategies whereas Argo Rollouts supports `blueGreen` and `canary` strategies.

Under the `blueGreen` strategy we have identified the active and preview Kubernetes services for the rollout which will be covered
in more detail when services are discussed next.

As well as services the field `autoPromotionEnabled` is set to `false` which means the rollout will require manual intervention to promote. Manual promotion
is enabled so the behavior of the application can be observed in more-depth in subsequent modules.

The Argo Rollouts documentation provides a complete list
of all of the link:https://argo-rollouts.readthedocs.io/en/stable/features/bluegreen/#configurable-features[configurable features, window='_blank'] for the blueGreen strategy
and additional features will be explored as we progress through the workshop.

.link:https://github.com/OpenShiftDemos/argo-rollouts-workshop/blob/main/documentation/modules/ROOT/examples/bluegreen/base/services.yaml[./bluegreen/base/services.yaml,window='_blank']
[source,yaml,subs="+macros,attributes+"]
----
include::ROOT:example$bluegreen/base/services.yaml[]
----

In the services we define two services, an active service and a preview service. The active service is the service that users of the application will be
interacting with, the preview service would be used to access the new version of the application for testing purposes. As per the link:https://argo-rollouts.readthedocs.io/en/stable/features/bluegreen/#overview[documentation,window='_blank'],
Argo Rollouts automatically manages the traffic between the services by managing the `.spec.selector`.

.link:https://github.com/OpenShiftDemos/argo-rollouts-workshop/blob/main/documentation/modules/ROOT/examples/bluegreen/base/routes.yaml[./bluegreen/base/routes.yaml,window='_blank']
[source,yaml,subs="+macros,attributes+"]
----
include::ROOT:example$bluegreen/base/routes.yaml[]
----

Finally we have two Route objects for active and preview with each tied to their respective service.

To deploy the blue-green rollout, use the following command to process the kustomization:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
oc apply -k ./bluegreen/base -n user%USERNUM%-prod
----

Once you have run the command we can confirm that the rollout has deployed successfully. Use the following command to ensure
that the pods are up and running:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
oc get pods -l app=rollouts-demo -n user%USERNUM%-prod
----

[NOTE]
We are getting pods using the label `app=rollouts-demo` to specifically select pods from the rollout, remember
the RolloutManager pod is also deployed in the `user%USERNUM%-prod` namespace.

The console should return something along the lines of

[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
NAME                             READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
rollouts-demo-66d84bcd76-pxtnc   1/1     Running   0          64s
rollouts-demo-66d84bcd76-q49wt   1/1     Running   0          64s
----

There are two pods since the Rollout again specified two replicas.

Next Open the Route for this application. It's in the `user%USERNUM%-dev1` Project.

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
oc get routes -n user%USERNUM%-prod'
----

[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
NAME      HOST/PORT                                                             PATH   SERVICES   PORT   TERMINATION     WILDCARD
active    active-user1-prod.apps.cluster-nh5nw.nh5nw.sandbox2534.opentlc.com           active     http   edge/Redirect   None
preview   preview-user1-prod.apps.cluster-nh5nw.nh5nw.sandbox2534.opentlc.com          preview    http   edge/Redirect   None
----

Copy the value of the `HOST/PORT` of each route into an individual browser tab to confirm that both display the application with blue squares.

Next let's examine the active and preview services that were deployed, run the following command to see the active service.

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
oc get svc active -o yaml -n user%USERNUM%-prod | oc neat
----

The console should display the service definition similar to the following:

[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  annotations:
    argo-rollouts.argoproj.io/managed-by-rollouts: rollouts-demo
  labels:
    app: rollouts-demo
  name: active
  namespace: user1-prod
spec:
  clusterIP: 172.30.104.238
  clusterIPs:
  - 172.30.104.238
  internalTrafficPolicy: Cluster
  ipFamilies:
  - IPv4
  ipFamilyPolicy: SingleStack
  ports:
  - name: http
    port: 8080
  selector:
    app: rollouts-demo
    rollouts-pod-template-hash: 66d84bcd76
----

Notice that the selector has an additional key, `rollouts-pod-template-hash`, with a hash value. This is how the rollout manages traffic
between the active and preview versions. Since we have not deployed a new image, if you check the preview service you will notice the same
selector there as well.

Similar to Kubernetes deployments, each revision, i.e. version, of the Rollout is backed by a link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/replicaset/[ReplicaSet,window='_blank'].
This ReplicaSet will have a `rollouts-pod-template-hash` label in it's PodTemplate with a value unique to the revision. Argo Rollouts will automatically ensure that
the selector in the service is pointing to the appropriate revision.

To view this, output the manifest for the currently deployed replicaset:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
oc get rs -l app=rollouts-demo -n user%USERNUM%-prod -o yaml | oc neat
----

[#argo-rollouts-dashboard]
== Argo Rollouts Dashboard

The Argo Rollouts dashboard has been deployed in the `user%USERNUM%-tools` namespace on the cluster for this workshop. To access the dashboard,
run the following command to get the URL for the dashboard for your specific user:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
oc get route -n user%USERNUM%-tools dashboard -o jsonpath='{"https://"}{.spec.host}{"\n"}'
----

Copy the returned URL into a browser tab to access the dashboard.

image::argo-rollout-dashboard.png[]

[NOTE]
The Argo Rollouts Dashboard is intended to be run on the developer's laptop and as a result it does not support
authentication or multi-tenancy. For convenience and simplicity it has been deployed on cluster for each user
but this is not recommended as a general practice.

In the dashboard each rollout will show in it's own tile on the overview screen. The tile will provide some
basic information about the rollout as shown here:

image::argo-rollout-dashboard-details.png[]

Clicking on the tile will display a detailed view of the rollout as well as additional actions that
are available for interacting with the rollout.

[#promote-image]
== Promote Image

In this module we will promote a new image and observe the behavior of the application during the promotion
process. To promote the image we will use a simple pipeline to update the image reference to use a different
color.

To access this pipeline, in the OpenShift Console navigate to the `user%USERNUM%-tools` namespace and select
the `Pipelines` view in the Developer perspective as per this screenshot.

image::console-pipelines-overview.png[]

Clicking on the pipeline name, `rollouts-pipeline`, will bring you to the following view:

image::console-pipelines-promote.png[]

As shown in the image, the pipeline consists of two tasks, the first which will update the image for the
Kubernetes Deployment in the `user%USERNUM%-dev` namespace and the second which will update the Rollout in the
``user%USERNUM%-prod` namespace.

[NOTE]
This pipeline is not meant to be a comprehensive example of how to do manage image promotion, rather we
are using it provide a simple way in the workshop to drive image changes. This pipeline uses OpenShift
Pipelines which comes with OpenShift however any CI tool can be used with Argo Rollouts including Argo Workflows,
GitHub Actions, GitLab, etc.
