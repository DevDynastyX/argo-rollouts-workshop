== Blue-Green Overview

In a blue-green deployment we deploy a new version of the application in a separate stack from the current version with
the two versions running in parallel for a period of time. This enables testing on the new version while users continue
to access the current version of the application until a cut-over of traffic happens. The diagram below shows this process
over time.
