== Canary Overview

Canary can be thought of as an advanced version of blue-green where instead of an abrupt cut-over
of live traffic between a current and new revision instead traffic is gradually increased to the new
version in increments, or steps. Like the canary in the coal mine euphemism, the idea is to allow
users to access the new version over time and if unexpected problems occur revert back to the
previous version.

This process is depicted in the diagram below where we see how we slowly migrate traffic from
the current version to the new version until the process is completed.
