= Workshop Overview
include::_attributes.adoc[]

In this module we will:

* Review the namespaces being used
* Review how Rollouts was deployed with OpenShift GitOps
* Deploy the application in the Development environment

[#workshop-namespaces]
== Workshop Namespaces

image::openshift-projects.png[]

In this workshop each user will have access to three OpenShift Projects, i.e. namespaces, as follows:

* *_{user}-dev_*: This represents the development environment for deploying the application as a Kubernetes Deployment so we can compare and contrast it to Rollouts.
* *_{user}-prod_*: This is our production environment, where we deploy a rollout for the application. During the workshop, you will deploy Rollouts using different strategies and analysis.
* *_{user}-tools_*: This is where the CI/CD tooling is located. It contains a pipeline to promote image changes across the development and production environments. The upstream *Rollouts Dashboard* user interface is also deployed in this namespace.

[#review-rollout-manager]
== Review RolloutManager Deployment

The *OpenShift GitOps Operator* simplifies the deployment and management of the Argo Rollouts in an OpenShift cluster.

To deploy Argo Rollouts using the operator we need to define and create a RolloutManager
custom resource in the namespace where we want to run the Rollout. In the case of our workshop a
RolloutManager has already been provisioned for the cluster in the `openshift-gitops` namespace.

The `openshift-gitops` namespace is not accessible with your credential however the
RolloutManager has been provisioned as per the yaml below:

[source,yaml,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: RolloutManager
metadata:
  name: cluster
  namespace: openshift-gitopss

[NOTE]
Argo Rollouts can be deployed as either a namespace or cluster scope. It has been provisioned here as cluster
scoped which is the default, namespace scope can be selected by setting `.spec.namespaceScoped: true`. NOTE
that only one cluster scoped instance of RolloutManager can exist on a cluster.

As shown above this is a simple declaration which in turn results in the Operator creating
a deployment with the Argo Rollout controller monitoring all namespaces on the cluster for
`Rollout` resources.

You can use the command '`oc explain RolloutManager.spec`' to see the supported configuration
options.

[NOTE]
The `oc` CLI tool is a superset of `kubectl` with some additional OpenShift specific features. We will use `oc` in this tutorial but if you prefer you can use `kubectl` as well.
In some `oc` commands in the workshop we are using a kubectl plugin called link:https://github.com/itaysk/kubectl-neat[kubectl-neat,window='_blank']
in order to tidy the yaml by removing additional fields, labels and annotations added automatically by Kubernetes.

[#deploy-application]
== Deploy Application

In order to proceed with this workshop we will need to deploy the application into the development
and production namespaces. The application that we will be deploying is the https://github.com/argoproj/rollouts-demo[Argo Rollouts Demo^]
application that displays colored squares.

image::rollouts-demo-app.png[]

Each time we need to deploy the application we will select a version of the application with a different color,
this will enable use to visually see how the application is progressing.

=== Clone the Repository

You need to clone the repository into your web terminal because you will need to
deploy various versions of the application as you progress through the workshop:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
git clone -b development --single-branch https://github.com/OpenShiftDemos/argo-rollouts-workshop ~/argo-rollouts-workshop
----

[NOTE]
We are cloning the `showroom` branch to support some specific requirements of the Show Room environment.

All of the code used in this workshop will be located in the folder:

`~/argo-rollouts-workshop/content/modules/ROOT/examples`

Once you have cloned the repo, enter this directory in the terminal:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
cd ~/argo-rollouts-workshop/content/modules/ROOT/examples/
----

=== Deploy Development

In the development environment we will be deploying the application as a basic
Kubernetes Deployment so that we can compare and contrast the behavior with Argo Rollouts.

To view the manifests that we will be using, examine the code in `./deploy/base`:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
ls ./deploy/base
----

You should see that there are four files in this directory. The `deploy.yaml`, `service.yaml`
and `route.yaml` represent the Deployment, Service and OpenShift Route respectively for the application.

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
cat ./deploy/base/deploy.yaml
----
[source,yaml,subs="+macros,attributes+"]
----
include::ROOT:example$deploy/base/deploy.yaml[]
----

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
cat ./deploy/base/service.yaml
----

[source,yaml,subs="+macros,attributes+"]
----
include::ROOT:example$deploy/base/service.yaml[]
----

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
cat ./deploy/base/route.yaml
----

[source,yaml,subs="+macros,attributes+"]
----
include::ROOT:example$deploy/base/route.yaml[]
----

[NOTE]
Routes are the way ingress is managed in OpenShift. Routes pre-date Kubernetes Ingress and
while OpenShift supports both Routes and Ingress, Routes retain some additional capabilities and
features not yet available in Ingress hence their continued usage.

There is a fourth file called `kustomization.yaml`, this file is used by the https://kustomize.io[Kustomize,window='_blank'] tool and enables
the management of Kubernetes manifests. Kustomize and Helm are the two most popular yaml management tools
in GitOps and we use kustomize here to simplify our deployments.

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
cat ./deploy/base/kustomization.yaml
----

[source,yaml,subs="+macros,attributes+"]
----
include::ROOT:example$deploy/base/kustomization.yaml[]
----

To deploy the application in Development, we will use the `apply` command with `-k` switch that is available in `kubectl` and `oc`
to process a kustomization. Run the following command in the terminal to deploy the application:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
oc apply -k ./deploy/base -n {user}-dev
----

Once you have run the command we can confirm that the deployment has run successfully. Use the following command to ensure
that the pods are up and running:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
oc get pods -n {user}-dev
----

The console should return something along the lines of:

[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
NAME                             READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
rollouts-demo-785c8b55cb-m5mzg   1/1     Running   0          6m51s
rollouts-demo-785c8b55cb-trvsd   1/1     Running   0          6m51s
----

There are two pods since the Deployment specified two replicas.

Next view the Route URL for this application. It's in the `{user}-dev1` Project.

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
oc get route -n {user}-dev rollouts-demo -o jsonpath='{"https://"}{.spec.host}{"\n"}'
----

You can confirm the application is running by clicking the following link or by copying the URL from the previous command:

https://rollouts-demo-{user}-dev.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}[https://rollouts-demo-{user}-dev.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}, window="_blank"]

You should see a grid of *blue* squares appearing and disappearing periodically as the application makes requests to its back-end
from the browser.

image::rollouts-demo-app-blue.png[]

In the next module we will deploy a *BlueGreen Rollouts* version of this application and compare and contrast it to
the traditional Kubernetes Deployment version of the application we just deployed.
